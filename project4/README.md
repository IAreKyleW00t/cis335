Project 4
---------
#### Description
  Asks the user for a single, positive integer through the C++ program and sends that value into the Assembly function `Mobonacci` through the stack. The Assembly function will then recursively calculate the value using the formula `f(n-2)/2 + f(n-1)*2` by popping and pushing values into multiple stacks.
  
#### Example Output
  ```
  Enter an integer: 5
  Mobonacci(5) = 20
  ```
